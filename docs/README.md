# eurostat-map.js

eurostat-map.js is now bundled and compiled using webpack & babel.  

### To install the project  

 -- Clone the repository
 -- cd into eurostat-map.js
 -- with node.js installed run "npm install"

### To run a development build

 -- run "npm run build-dev"
 This will use the configuration in webpack.config.dev.js to build a non-minified development bundle containing source maps and place it in the /build folder as eurostatmap.js

### To run a production build

-- run "npm run build-prod"
 This will use the configuration in webpack.config.prod.js to build a minified development bundle without source maps and place it in the /build folder as eurostatmap.min.js


### Testing

To run tests, use "npm test". This will execute eurostatmap.test.js using jest. Jest will execute the code in this file using a headless chrome upon test.html.
